## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a results-driven and highly motivated engineering expert with extensive project management experience. My passion for Software Development, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence led me to pursue a master's degree in computer science, allowing me to transition into the technology sector.

As someone who thrives on new challenges, I am keen to apply my exploratory spirit and quick learning talents in the IT field. With a strong academic background in computer science and engineering, I am eager to use my knowledge of SQL, Python, C, JavaScript, and Cloud Services to make a major contribution to my future organization.

In addition to my technical abilities, my extensive experience has sharpened my interpersonal and soft skills, making me a great communicator, negotiator, and team player, in addition to my technical prowess. I have established a great capacity to effectively interact with varied teams, maintain schedules, and ensure seamless project execution as a result of my expertise managing large-scale projects. My commitment to continual development has enabled me to succeed at resource management and developing great relationships with colleagues and stakeholders alike. As I move into the technology sector, I am convinced that my diverse skill set will significantly contribute to the success of my future ventures and the organizations with whom I interact.
